# midnightbot
A cubing discord bot with tons of comp &amp; scramble features. It is one of the first bots to have full WCA legal scrambles and has a pb storer as well. It has a ton of comp features and is one of the best bots out there for your cubing server. The scrambles are made available by the courtesy of ecuber and euphwes (the modules are scrambler-util and pyTwistyScrambler) and some scrambles were generated using my module, pycubescrambler. Thanks to cstimer for providing the code for my 4x4 scrambles.
